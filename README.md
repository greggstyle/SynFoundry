Our goal is to launch a cybersecurity bootcamp in 2019.
Based on our previous bootcamp with LeWagon, we have decided to use Ruby on rails to create our website. 

Looking forward to send more updates by next year.

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
