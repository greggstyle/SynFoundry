[SynFoundry](http://http://synfoundry.com/) is an cybersecurity bootcamp to be launched in 2019.
Based on our previous bootcamp with LeWagon, we have decided to use Ruby on rails to create our website. 

Looking forward to send more updates by next year. 

Louis and Greg


Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
